# I Am AlexJamesDean

I have been since the age of 12. Something a lot of people don't know about me is that I grew up in an internet cafÃ©... 
I didn't live there I just got a super sweet deal on internet time whilst not having a personal computer. 

## When I realised 

One day I had just got done purchasing 'Credits' an in-game currency for the game I was playing at the time (Habbo Hotel) and I decided that spending
Â£3 on fake money for a game I wouldn't play forever was too much. So I looked into ways of hacking into the game to get free credits (Yes, this was probably illegal).
I never did work out how to hack the game to give me free currency other than being able to inject session id's but that required stealing user data and I'm
no blackhat so I left it at that. What I did gain from this experience though was a minor understanding of code and how it worked, code has always seemed to flow as
normal as everyday english when I see it. This led me to recreating my own private version of their website, tweaking it in ways that could essentially benefit myself.

From there I started coding in PHP, or 'tracing' around already existing code, linking my own SQL database and then the only problem I found was having access to an emulator,
something that powered the internal functions of the game before javascript was so widely available with all of its new libraries. I had a friend that had a friend that was dating a really good programmer at the time online, we worked together and by my 14th birthday we had successfully recreated the entire game. We did run into issues later on due to using their copyrighted materials but we learned something valuable and it was an experience that led me to my passions in coding.

## What Else?

Well when we got into trouble for the copyright infringements we were ordered to stay away from the game for a minimum of two years, lucky we didn't have to pay a fine. This led to the main 20 person team that we had built up and even bigger community dispersing and getting on with real life. This was good for all of us and allowed me to figure out my purpose and get on with education. During this time I was studying music and media whilst being very active with both a piano and a camera phone I had gotten one christmas.
I would shoot amatuer footage of me and friends on busses, skating around ikea and just generally being teenagers. Doing this I wanted to make it all look visually appealing, I begun searching for ways to make my videos look nice, add titles, transitions and even artifacts completely created by myself in photoshop. I was 17 and in College when I lost access to my first YouTube Channel due to the switch when google bought them out. Wahay for people wanting to make money on the platform, boo for the everyday user looking for new and interesting ways to complete tasks.

I carried on gaming and got quite good at it on the Xbox 360, getting myself into numerous online groups with sponsorships from partners like Machinima and Kontroller Freaks, even went head to head with the early FaZe clan a few times in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Of course we lost but we had a nice chat with the team after and still came 2nd place in the tournament overall. This made me want to record my gameplay for YouTube like so many others were starting to do at the time, before money was even a part of the process. I wanted to entertain others with the content I was producing and I still do to this day. 

## What's next?

I have a bunch of things lined up but I am currently unwell and not getting much work in my hometown. However I'n always looking for new opportunities to better myself and the wider world web around me. I'm not all about developing websites for clients on an ad-hoc basis. I want to build brands from the ground up, I dream big because I know these are things I can and will achieve with the right support from businesses that believe in me as much as I believe in myself.

Project 2:

Escape From Tarkov | UK Division
Owner/Founder
EFTUK is an information service for a PC Video Game based around War and Strategy.

I believe in these projects as they both provide content that embody what I do, the design might seem a bit off to most and might even make people think that I do design obnoxiously but it's more a statement as to 'you get what you pay for' I put around 30 total hours work into the OBNXS website over 4 days, if you think it needs work, it does and I do small tasks daily to keep it up which is why I'll be adding the code to github as soon as it is cleaned up (The footer looks kind of nasty for SEO purposes currently).
EFT UK is a proof of concecpt allow myself to show that I can edit child themes within wordpress and manipulated the code without causing errors. Yes very basic to most geeks out there but I have to show I can somehow.
